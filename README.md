# Overview
**Welcome Or Die** is a bot that mandates user greetings upon joining the server; failure to do so results in a kick from the server after 30 seconds. If a user joining the server is not welcomed, they will be kicked.


# Feature
1. **Welcome Message Kick:** Users face expulsion after 30 seconds if not welcomed.

# Project Background
*A while ago, I attempted to create this bot with limited Python skills and faced failure. Seven months later, with improved proficiency, I remade it. This bot is not commercial; it's a personal, fun project.*
